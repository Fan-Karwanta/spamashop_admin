# SPAMASHOP - ADMIN PANEL

This is the repository for the admin panel of SPAMASHOP.

Still in development, the features will be posted here once the development concludes.

To Do list (As of Sept. 27, 2024) :
1.) Admin Authentication = Develop a fully functional authentication (login) for the admin to have access to the platform
(You can do passkey like "malita-doc" , or you can also do the traditional authentication panel)

2.) Learn about how to modify the data coming from database to the admin panel itself. (In short, watch the edroh course about the admin panel)

3.) All the data in the system are dummy data. So you need to make the admin panel functional by connecting it to the MAIN
DATABASE of SPAMASHOP.
  - once you connected to the database, you must know how to retrieve data to a specific column / document file
  - for you to be connected in the MAIN DATABASE of SPAMASHOP and display the ACTUAL SPAMASHOP DATA.

3.) All the placeholders of the dummy data should be remodified depending on the field names in the MAIN SPAMASHOP database, and
all of the functions must be functional.
